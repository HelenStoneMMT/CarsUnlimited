# Cars Unlimited

This project is to replace v1 of Cars Unlimited used in Docker, Azure DevOps and Kubernetes workshops. It's purpose is to provide a portable, multi-service architecture utilising modern technologies such as Open Telemetry, Open API and Kubernetes. It will also serve as an example for polyglot architectures much in the same way as eShopOnContainers but in a much more rudimentary format.

It is a work in progress.
